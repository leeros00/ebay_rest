We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug Fixes**: If you find a bug, consider fixing it and submitting a pull request.
- **New Features**: Submit an issue or a pull request with your proposed enhancement.
- **Documentation**: Improvements to documentation are always welcome.

### Contribution Tips
- Review error codes in the `Error` class.
- Check for `README.md` files in subdirectories; they may contain additional information.
- Follow test-driven development: modify `tests/ebay_rest.py` while implementing changes.
- Run `/scripts/generate_code.py` periodically to sync with eBay API updates.
- Some unit tests may fail due to eBay's sandbox resetting dailyâ€”retry the next day if needed.
