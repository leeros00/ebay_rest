## How to Contribute
We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug Fixes**: If you find a bug, consider fixing it and submitting a pull request.
- **New Features**: Submit an issue or a pull request with your proposed enhancement.
- **Documentation**: Improvements to documentation are always welcome.

### Contribution Tips
- Review error codes in the `Error` class.
- Check for `README.md` files in subdirectories; they may contain additional information.
- Follow test-driven development: modify `tests/ebay_rest.py` while implementing changes.
- Run `/scripts/generate_code.py` periodically to sync with eBay API updates.
- Some unit tests may fail due to eBay's sandbox resetting dailyâ€”retry the next day if needed.

## Release Steps

1. **Update dependencies and tools:**
   ```bash
   brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup  # macOS only
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip && python -m pip install --upgrade -e ".[complete,dev]"
   playwright install chromium
   pipreqs --print src  # Lists required dependencies
   ```

2. **Update `pyproject.toml`**:
   - Update dependencies based on `pipreqs` output.
   - Increment the [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) accordingly.

3. **Validate changes:**
   - Regenerate code from the latest eBay OpenAPI contracts. This updates [a_p_i.py](src/ebay_rest/a_p_i.py) and the [api](src/ebay_rest/api) package:
   ```bash
   /scripts/generate_code.py
   ```
   - Run all unit tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --tb=short -q
   ```
   - Fix any issues without modifying the generated code directly.

4. **Build and publish the package:**
   ```bash
   black .
   python3 -m build
   python3 -m twine upload dist/*X.Y.Z*
   ```
   Replace `X.Y.Z` with the new version number and provide credentials when prompted.
